# Password Manager

Password Manager is a free and secure space where you can store your credentials for all your applications.
It is one of my first Flutter Projects.

## Getting Started

Why You'd have to memorize all your username, emails and passwords when you can store them in an application?
You will say: "Because is unsafe!" and You'll be right.
But what if this problem can be solved?

In this app You can find some security level such as:

- Local storage (No data will leave your device)
- Data encryption
- Authentication, in order to see your credentials

It's my first mobile application so I advice You to test it till You are satisfied.
I'd appreciate some feedback and bug report to improve this application. :)

By the way It's a personal project so I release myself from all liability :) .
