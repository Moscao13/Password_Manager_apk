# Password Manager

Password Manager is a free and secure space where you can store your credentials for all your applications.
It is one of my first Flutter Projects.

## Getting Started

Why You'd have to memorize all your username, emails and passwords when you can store them in an application?
You will say: "Because is unsafe!" and You'll be right.
But what if this problem can be solved?

Password Manager can be considered safe because credentials are stored in your local filesystem so
no data will leave your phone and nobody will be able to sniff your credentials. In order to have more safety, credentials
will be encrypted before storing them on filesystem.
But the safety is never enough so in order to see your credentials You have to authenticate yourself
with biometric or with password.
Session will not memorize your authentication which is requested everytime You want to see your credentials.

I know what You are thinking: "In order to see my passwords I have to memorize a password!", It's funny
doesn't It?
But the gain is that You have to memorize only one password for every your password.

By the way It's a personal project so I release myself from all liability :) .
